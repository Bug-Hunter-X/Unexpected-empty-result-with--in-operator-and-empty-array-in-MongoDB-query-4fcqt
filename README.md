# MongoDB Query with $in Operator and Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns no results, even if the field is not required or is set to null.  This behavior might be unexpected for developers unfamiliar with this nuance.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation that accounts for empty arrays.

## Problem

A common practice is to dynamically generate MongoDB queries based on user input. However, if the user provides no criteria for a specific field, an empty array might be passed to the `$in` operator, which results in an empty result set.

## Solution

The solution involves checking if the input array is empty before constructing the query. If it's empty, the condition should be omitted entirely to avoid unintended behavior.
